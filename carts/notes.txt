# first, we need to get the id of the product based on the id.
# after that, i think we check if the request.method is a post request.

if the request is a post request, meaning a user is trying to add some product to the cartitem:
        then we need to get the  cart_id of that user and the the product and cart so that it can be in the cart item.
           Once the cart_id and the product are filtered, then whenever the user presses on the add_to_cart button,
           it should redirect them to the cart.html together with the product associated with it sessionID
           add the quantity of the product in the cart item
           
           
           
            if it does:
                we loop through the cart item, then append the id to the id list. After that,
                if what the user submits is already in the cart, then it should increase its quantity instead of creating a new cart item
                then just add the quantity of that item in the cart
            else:
                it should create a new cart item and actually put it in the cart.
                it should redirect the user to the cart.html whenever it is added




        we check, if that item a user wants to add already exist in the cartitem:




Here is for the cart function:
    First, we just need to get the cartID of that user and the items it contains with it. Then we assign it to
    cart_items, which we will loop through. Then increase the quantity and the total. Then we pass it to context dictionary
