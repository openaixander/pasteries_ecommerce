Well, first:
    We need to create a registration form which user can actually sign up.
    It consist of the name, phone number, email etc.


If the user signs in, then user need to activate their account for them to sign in. 
After making sure they activate their account, then it should take them to the login page with telling them that thier account has been activated


So we need to assign the cart item whenever the user is about to place an order.
